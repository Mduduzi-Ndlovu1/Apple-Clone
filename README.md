## Features

The Features component showcases the design and functionality of the iPhone using videos and images, highlighting its aesthetics and technological advancements.

## Features Component Explanation

The **Features** component in this project showcases the design and features of the iPhone 15 Pro, particularly focusing on its titanium construction. Here’s a breakdown of what was implemented and why, from a front-end development perspective:

### GSAP Animation Integration

- **useGSAP Hook**: Utilized `useGSAP` hook from `@gsap/react` to initialize GSAP animations upon component mount. This ensures smooth and interactive animations throughout the component.
- **ScrollTrigger Animation**: Implemented GSAP's ScrollTrigger to animate elements such as the video (`#exploreVideo`) when it enters the viewport, enhancing user engagement.
- **Custom Animations**: Employed `animateWithGsap` function from `../utils/animations` to animate components like the title (`#features_title`), images (`.g_grow`), and text (`.g_text`) with properties like opacity, scale, and position for visual appeal.

### HTML Structure and Styling

- **Semantic HTML**: Used semantic HTML elements (`<section>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<video>`, `<img>`, `<p>`) for accessibility and SEO optimization.
- **Responsive Design**: Integrated Tailwind CSS classes (`screen-max-width`, `mb-12`, `mt-32`, `sm:px-10`, `h-[50vh]`, `flex-center`) to ensure responsive layouts across different screen sizes and maintain consistent spacing and alignment.

### Multimedia Integration

- **Video Element**: Incorporated a `<video>` element (`exploreVideo`) to showcase the iPhone’s promotional video with attributes set for auto-play, muted, and preload for optimal user experience.
- **Image Elements**: Used images (`explore1Img`, `explore2Img`) to complement video content and visually reinforce the product’s titanium design features.

### Textual Content

- **Feature Descriptions**: Strategically placed textual content to describe the iPhone’s titanium construction features. Highlighted key information with specific styling (`feature-text`, `text-white`) to emphasize product attributes effectively.

## Why These Choices Were Made

- **GSAP for Animation**: Chose GSAP for its performance, flexibility, and extensive feature set, enabling precise control over animations and ensuring smooth transitions to enhance user interaction and visual appeal.

- **Semantic HTML and Accessibility**: Ensured accessibility and improved SEO by using semantic HTML elements that provide meaningful structure to content, benefiting users with disabilities and search engine crawlers.

- **Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS**: Implemented Tailwind CSS utility classes for rapid prototyping and responsive design, maintaining design consistency across various devices without extensive custom CSS.

- **Multimedia Integration**: Combined videos and images to create a multimedia experience that effectively showcases the iPhone’s features, catering to diverse user preferences and enhancing engagement.
- **Textual Clarity and Highlighting**: Provided clear and concise feature descriptions with highlighted text to effectively communicate key product attributes, improving user comprehension and emphasizing unique selling points.

### Conclusion

The implementation of the **Features** component aims to deliver an immersive and informative experience for users exploring the iPhone 15 Pro’s titanium design features. The use of GSAP for animations, Tailwind CSS for responsive design, and multimedia integration contributes to a compelling user interface aligned with modern web development standards and practices.

## Hero

The Hero component introduces users to Apple products with a captivating video and a call-to-action button to engage visitors.

## Hero Component Explanation

The **Hero** component in this project serves as the introductory section showcasing the iPhone Pro. Here’s a breakdown of what was implemented and why, from a front-end development perspective:

### Dynamic Video Source Selection

- **useState Hook**: Utilized `useState` hook to dynamically set the video source (`videoSrc`) based on the window width. This ensures that smaller screens load a smaller video (`smallHeroVideo`), optimizing performance and user experience.
- **useEffect Hook**: Used `useEffect` hook to add and remove a resize event listener (`handleVideoSrcSet`). When the window is resized, it checks the window width and updates the video source accordingly, ensuring responsiveness without excessive re-renders.
- **Video Element**: Integrated a `<video>` element with attributes for autoplay, muted, and playsInline to ensure seamless video playback and compatibility across different browsers and devices.

### GSAP Animation Integration

- **useGSAP Hook**: Implemented the `useGSAP` hook from `@gsap/react` to animate elements (`#hero`, `#cta`) upon component mount. GSAP animations are triggered with a delay (`1.5s`) to enhance visual appeal and user engagement.
- **GSAP Animations**: Used GSAP's `gsap.to` method to animate the opacity and position (`y`) of elements (`#hero`, `#cta`). This provides smooth transitions and visual effects, making the hero section more interactive and appealing.

### HTML Structure and Styling

- **Semantic HTML**: Used semantic HTML elements (`<section>`, `<p>`, `<video>`, `<a>`, `<div>`) for accessibility and SEO optimization, ensuring a clear structure and meaningful content.
- **CSS Classes**: Applied Tailwind CSS utility classes (`w-full`, `flex-center`, `flex-col`, `opacity-0`, `translate-y-20`, `md:w-10/12`, `w-9/12`) for consistent styling and responsive design. This ensures that the hero section maintains its layout and appearance across various screen sizes.

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Button

- **CTA Button**: Included a call-to-action button (`<a>` tag) with a link (`#highlights`) to encourage user interaction. Styled with a Tailwind CSS class (`btn`) for a visually appealing button design.
- **Price Information**: Added a price indication (`From $199/month or $999`) below the CTA button to inform users about pricing options, enhancing transparency and decision-making.

## Why These Choices Were Made

- **Dynamic Video Source**: Chose to dynamically select the video source based on screen width to optimize performance and ensure seamless playback on smaller devices, providing a better user experience.

- **GSAP for Animation**: Implemented GSAP animations to create smooth transitions and visual effects, enhancing the hero section's visual appeal and engagement.

- **Responsive Design**: Used Tailwind CSS for responsive design to maintain consistent layout and styling across different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability.

- **CTA Button and Price Information**: Included a prominent CTA button and price information to guide user actions and provide essential details upfront, improving user engagement and conversion potential.

### Conclusion

The **Hero** component effectively introduces the iPhone Pro with dynamic video content, GSAP animations, and a compelling call-to-action, showcasing best practices in front-end development for creating engaging and responsive web experiences.
